# Learn Python Science Libs in Baby Steps

Python is one of the most popular programming languages for data science
and therefore enjoys a large number of useful add-on libraries developed by
its great community.
Although the performance of interpreted languages, such as Python, for computation-intensive
tasks is inferior to lower-level programming languages, extension libraries such as NumPy and SciPy 
have been developed that build upon lower layer Fortran and C implementations for fast and 
vectorized operations on multidimensional arrays.

Here we will start our journey by learning the following libraries:

Install Anaconda from:
